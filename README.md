**3D resistor network solution for d.c. forward simulation problems. Matlab implementation.**

A Python version is also available atï¼š

- https://github.com/sustechgem/RESnet-py

Run the following scripts:

- RUNME.m: A self-testing program to ensure a correct installation and to demonstrate the workflow of software

- Example_Halfspace.m: Verification of the numerical accuracy by comparing with the analytic solution of a half-space

- Example_Casing.m: Simulation of the surface electric field with the presence of steel well casing

- Example_Infrastructure.m: Effect of complex metallic infrastructure on the surface dc resistivity data

Software environment:

- Tested with MATLAB R2020b and R2022a

- Should be compatible with recent MATLAB releases
